## Project Background

In web frontend development, adding Live2D models typically requires using the official Live2D Cubism SDK, but the official SDK is relatively complex to use and not very friendly to modern frontend framework integration. The easy-live2d project aims to solve these problems by providing a simpler and more friendly way to use Live2D models.

## Core Features

- **Based on Pixi.js**: Fully leveraging Pixi.js's powerful WebGL rendering capabilities and easy-to-use API
- **Lightweight Design**: Removing redundant features, focusing on core functionality implementation
- **Simplified API**: Providing more intuitive and concise API interfaces, lowering the barrier to entry
- **Compatibility**: Supporting the latest Cubism 5 SDK and Pixi.js v8
- **Extensibility**: Offering rich event systems and customizable configuration options
- **Framework-friendly**: Easy to integrate with modern frontend frameworks such as Vue and React

## Difference from the Official SDK

easy-live2d is not a replacement for the official Live2D Cubism SDK, but rather a wrapper and optimization based on it, making it more suitable for web developers. Compared to the official SDK, easy-live2d has the following advantages:

- Simplifies complex APIs, reducing the learning curve
- Better integrates with the Pixi.js ecosystem, allowing Live2D models to be used like ordinary Pixi sprites
- Provides a more intuitive event handling mechanism
- Optimized for web scenarios to enhance performance

## Suitable Scenarios

easy-live2d is suitable for the following scenarios:

- Web applications that need to add Live2D models as virtual assistants or characters
- Game development that needs to integrate Live2D models as characters or UI elements
- Interactive content that requires vivid character expressions
- Quick integration of Live2D functionality in modern frameworks like Vue and React
