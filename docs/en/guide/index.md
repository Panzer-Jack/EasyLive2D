# What is EasyLive2D

EasyLive2D is a lightweight, developer-friendly Live2D Web SDK wrapper based on Pixi.js, designed to simplify the integration and use of Live2D models in web applications.

## Project Background

In web frontend development, adding Live2D models typically requires using the official Live2D Cubism SDK, which can be relatively complex and not particularly friendly for integration with modern frontend frameworks. The EasyLive2D project aims to solve these problems by providing a simpler, more developer-friendly way to use Live2D models.

## Core Features

- **Based on Pixi.js**: Fully leverages Pixi.js's powerful WebGL rendering capabilities and easy-to-use API
- **Lightweight Design**: Removes redundant features, focusing on core functionality
- **Simplified API**: Provides more intuitive, concise API interfaces, lowering the barrier to entry
- **Compatibility**: Supports the latest Cubism 5 SDK and Pixi.js v8
- **Extensibility**: Offers a rich event system and customizable configuration options
- **Framework-friendly**: Easy to integrate with modern frontend frameworks like Vue and React

## Differences from the Official SDK

EasyLive2D is not a replacement for the official Live2D Cubism SDK, but rather a wrapper and optimization built on top of it, making it more suitable for web developers. Compared to the official SDK, EasyLive2D offers the following advantages:

- Simplifies complex APIs, reducing the learning curve
- Better integrates with the Pixi.js ecosystem, allowing Live2D models to be used like regular Pixi sprites
- Provides more intuitive event handling mechanisms
- Optimized for web scenarios

## Use Cases

EasyLive2D is suitable for the following scenarios:

- Web applications that need to add Live2D models as virtual assistants or characters
- Game development requiring Live2D models as characters or UI elements
- Interactive content needing vivid character expressions
- Quick integration of Live2D functionality in modern frameworks like Vue and React
