# What is easy-live2d

easy-live2d is a lightweight, developer-friendly Live2D Web SDK wrapper based on Pixi.js, designed to simplify the integration and use of Live2D models in web applications.

## Project Background

In web frontend development, adding Live2D models typically requires using the official Live2D Cubism SDK, which can be relatively complex and not very friendly for integration with modern frontend frameworks. The easy-live2d project aims to solve these problems by providing a simpler and more developer-friendly way to use Live2D models.

## Core Features

- **Based on Pixi.js**: Leverages the powerful WebGL rendering capabilities and easy-to-use APIs of Pixi.js
- **Lightweight Design**: Removes redundant features, focusing on core functionality
- **Simplified API**: Provides more intuitive and concise API interfaces, lowering the barrier to entry
- **Compatibility**: Supports the latest Cubism 5 SDK and Pixi.js v8
- **Extensibility**: Offers a rich event system and customizable configuration options
- **Framework-friendly**: Easy to integrate with modern frontend frameworks like Vue and React

## Differences from the Official SDK

easy-live2d is not a replacement for the official Live2D Cubism SDK, but rather a wrapper and optimization built on top of it, making it more suitable for web developers. Compared to the official SDK, easy-live2d has the following advantages:

- Simplifies complex APIs, reducing the learning curve
- Better integration with the Pixi.js ecosystem, allowing Live2D models to be used like regular Pixi sprites
- Provides more intuitive event handling mechanisms
- Optimized for web scenarios with performance in mind

## Use Cases

easy-live2d is suitable for the following scenarios:

- Adding Live2D models as virtual assistants or characters in web applications
- Integrating Live2D models as characters or UI elements in game development
- Creating lively character expressions in interactive content
- Quickly integrating Live2D functionality in modern frameworks like Vue and React
